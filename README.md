Introducing <i>deninkan</i>, an open-source QR code based identity verification solution by Nippon Malaya. Deninkan's purpose is to replace traditional handwritten signatures and East Asian seals with QR code stamps by Deninkan to practically make document forgery a thing of the past. The QR code is tied to the Deninkan 2KEY Systemâ„¢ which insures the QR code stamp is valid and authentic for the given document.
